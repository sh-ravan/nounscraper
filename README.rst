Noun Project Scraper (WIP)
==========================

The noun project website has redesigned several times since this was written, and it will assuredly not work anymore.

-----

`The Noun Project <http://thenounproject.com>`_ is excellent, but the experience of downloading and using large numbers of icons from it is poor.  You download a zip file, which you then have to extract, and it has a random ID name rather than a meaningful noun name, and then associating the proper attribution with the icon is a pain.

This simple scraper makes this easier!  Point it at an index file on http://thenounproject.com, and it downloads the icons found on that page.  It:

 * Downloads the .svg
 * Creates a JSON format file with all the metadata associated with it
 * Converts the .svg to .png's in a variety of sizes
 * Formats proper attribution as html.
 * Names everything with the noun for easy file browsing.

Downloads are cached and throttled to a maximum of one every 5 seconds to be
nice, and stay within the terms of use of the website.

Requirements
------------

Relies on `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html>`_, `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, `BeautifulSoup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup>`_, `inkscape <http://inkscape.org/>`_ (used in non-gui mode), and a unix-ish command environment (OS X or Linux).

Python dependencies can be installed with::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----

::

    python scrape.py <nounproject index URL> [<more URLs> ...]
 
example::

    python scrape.py http://thenounproject.com/collections/modern-pictograms/

The script will create two directories:

 * `cache`: A cache of html files downloaded from thenounproject.com.  Files will be preferentially used from the cache first, to avoid hitting the server.  If you want to re-download after having run the script, remove this directory and its contents.
 * `icons`: The icons downloaded end up here.  Files are named according to the scheme::

    <noun>-<icon-id>.svg                => the original svg.
    <noun>-<icon-id>.json               => metadata in json format.
    <noun>-<icon-id>-<size>.png         => rasterized icons in png format.
    <noun>-<icon-id>-attribution.html   => attribution in HTML format.
